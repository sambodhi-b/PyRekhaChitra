## Immediate Goal

Build a text diagram building tool

## Stretch Goal

1. Declarative Diagramming
    1. Natural language interaction avaialable
    2. NL translated to diagram specification using LLM-generator
    3. Diagram specification direct input with auto-complete and suggestions
2. Chat like interface
    1. Live preview pane
    2. Natural Language Interaction pane
    3. Generated diagram specification pane
    4. Menu bar
3. Environment Agnostic
    1. No network mode (GPU provides LLM functionality, absence of GPU allows
       only non-assisted diagram specification)
    2. Local with network (API calls provide LLM functionality)
    3. Cloud (Fully hosted solution)
4. Open
    1. Open Source
    2. Import and Export of Open Source formats
    3. Inter-operability with proprietary solutions
